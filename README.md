# Ataxx-python: A python program that let's you play ataxx against AI
This project includes an option for manual players or an AI. The AI is implemented through a minimax algorithm, a greedy algorithm and a random move algorithm.

You can also choose between 7 boards to play in that can be seen in the "boards" folder, the X's mark the places where you can't put your pieces.
The seventh board is random, each player has 2 pieces that can be anywhere and there are between 0 and 20 blocked places.



Disclaimer: this was my first "big" programming project so if you came here to find a good code you can use, i'm sorry, but you've come to the wrong place :).
