# Ataxx-python: A python program that let's you play ataxx against AI
This project includes an option for manual players or an AI. The AI is implemented through a minimax algorithm, a greedy algorithm and a random move algorithm.

You can also choose between 7 boards to play in that can be seen in the "boards" folder, the X's mark the places where you can't put your pieces at.
The seventh board is random, each player has 2 pieces that can be anywhere and there are between 0 and 20 blocked places.
